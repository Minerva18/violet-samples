Both groups are wrong. They should both be focusing on service as a creator of new customer value, not treating it as an overhead function whose goal is merely to close the service case. There's little profit, and even less loyalty, to be found in settling for ""customer satisfaction.""

Look at one other number: 80% of businesses say their customers want to redefine what they are buying as a package of services, priced for the outcome it achieves, rather than a product priced for what the spec sheet says. The future belongs to those who see service as profitable opportunity for customer engagement, loyalty, and evangelism.

Nevertheless, establishing a toehold of momentum by identifying the most critical pain points, with potential milestone-by-milestone project sponsorship has proven feasible. Today the vision of having an unobstructed, 360-degree view of IU's recruits and students is now a reality for 7 campuses and across the Office of Online programs using the Salesforce Service Cloud. Recruitment capabilities encompasses interaction management, admission events, webforms, and recruiting communications. Additionally, over 150 communication units with 250+ users share the Salesforce Marketing Cloud capabilities across IU. The momentum is real now.

It's building momentum in our daily culture - from our shopping experiences, to how we converse with our customers, to how we engage with the devices in our own homes. But what is this world of AI, and how do we transform a seemingly intangible concept to tactile benefits that can be applied across any industry, from healthcare, to retail, to financial services?

We've listened to customers ask this question and now we're bringing this street cred to you. In this session, we'll walk through some best practices that you can take home for a strategic approach to incorporate AI into your business. We'll break down your exploration into AI with digestible steps, including:

1. Understanding your data and where it comes from
2. Identifying a business case, problem or question
3. Analyzing your data with human-led discovery to identify trends
4. Using a machine-led army (AI) to amplify your analysis and take action

After this session, you'll be equipped with a plan to not only draw from the insights of AI within your organization, but also build the framework to take meaningful actions right in context to your daily operations."

Recognizing there is power in numbers, 11 of the largest public research universities, collectively known as the University Innovation Alliance, have come partnered together to accelerate the pace of innovation. They've recognized that one particular technology or best practice won't suffice, but improving the way that technologies and new solutions are shared and scaled across campuses has the potential to fundamentally change the way we serve students. In order for universities to meet their goals, communication and knowledge sharing must travel beyond the IT department.

From a rep's perspective, the very support designed to make selling easier, has, in fact, actually made it harder - a phenomenon especially frustrating to sales enablement executives bombarded nearly every day by front-line seller requests for better tools and more help because the resources they've been provided so far aren't really what we need. In a world where sales complexity means we can no longer leave reps to fend for themselves, find out why less is almost always more when it comes to building the kind of sales enablement that not only supports the sale, but supports the seller at the same time.

Governments are expected to go faster, do more with less, and meet citizen expectations in “digital time.”  It’s placing enormous pressure on governments of every size to reimagine citizen and partner engagement to be smarter, always-on, and more productive and affordable. There is a real sense that governments’ credibility and legitimacy depends on the ability to deliver high-quality public benefits and services.

This disruption demands more than a snail-paced service evolution.  It requires governments to embrace and democratize innovation across operations to improve mission delivery and citizen engagement. With streamlined processes and future-proof solutions, governments can transform from the outdated bureaucratic maze to the government of the future that puts the citizen at the heart of everything.

Learn how Salesforce and our partners are building these governments of the future by getting closer to citizens and delivering services that don’t just meet expectations but elevate them. Hear our customers share how they partner with Salesforce to reach new levels of productivity and satisfaction."

Information collected directly by the School of Accountancy for the admissions process was kept in both Microsoft Access databases or Excel spreadsheets. When asked to pull reports for accreditation and surveys, it would take days to gather the pertinent data from all the various systems. With the implementation of Salesforce, we now have all the data imported nightly from both graduate and undergraduate applications systems into one location. We are able to directly enter our supplemental information into Salesforce to add to the complete picture of the applicant. This enables us to then pull quantitative data from the application and prerequisite reviews to create our score predictor to predict how a student would perform in the program as compared to past students. Since all of the admissions data in now in one location, we can pull reports when requested for administration in a matter of minutes. With the real-time analysis of both past and currently accepted applicants, we have seen the average credentials of our accepted candidates increase by .4 in overall GPA and even more importantly we have seen program GPA increase by greater than .7. We are now able to evaluate a candidate based on a similar candidate profile when determining their admission decision. This quantitative data added to the qualitative characteristics of a specific candidate helps ensure that we are getting the best possible incoming class for our programs.

One report estimates the skills gap is expected to result in 2 million unfilled jobs over the next decade. Community Colleges (and many four year schools) are laser-focused on helping students identify a 'guided pathway' for a specific job, like 'Automotive Engine Specialist' or 'Healthcare Specialist', identifying the specific courses needed to qualify for real jobs offered locally, and helping students overcome barriers to stay on the guided pathway to completion, and employment. Salesforce and Viridis Learning are collaborating to offer the Accountability Data Tracking System to enable Advisors/Counselors to provide services to improve student success, help the student identify their pathway, stay on the pathway to completion, and get the job for which their training qualifies them. It also helps the school report on the data that quantifies their accountability to qualify for state and federal workforce development programs. San Jose Community College is deploying the Accountability Data Tracking System to help their students succeed. Join this Panel Discussion to learn about one school's vision to deploy innovative technology to deliver better outcomes to their students, and strengthen America's workforce."

During this same time, Wall Street has begun to understand and value the benefits that a subscription model can provide.  As a result executive leaders and intrapreneurs are finding innovative ways to disrupt their own companies and reshape markets.  Some are experimenting on the margin to figure out the formula while others have gone all in to transform and re-invent their entire company.

As enterprises move towards recurring revenue services, it's not enough to get the customer experience right at the moment of the transaction, there must be a focus on the regular addition of rich, value-driven features to the service to retain subscribers.  Ongoing enablement is a key component of the recurring revenue model precisely because subscriptions can be easily abandoned if customers find better value elsewhere.

In this session we'll discuss recurring revenue market trends, transformation patterns and the pitfalls we've seen companies make as they have attempted to implement these new models.  We'll also share our thoughts on the elements for success and try to illuminate a path you can take as you blaze your trail to a new recurring revenue business model."

It is difficult to envision our future selves, or to anticipate the implications of decisions longer term.  To think about, plan for and realize a shared and mutually beneficial future, it is imperative that we overcome this “imagination gap”.  Could engaging in massive multiplayer games overcome our neurobiology, enhance our ability to imagine possible futures, rapidly pilot new ideas, inspire us to action and accelerate creating a better world together?

Jane McGonigal is a world-renowned game designer, inventor of the game “SuperBetter”, and author of two New York Times bestsellers, SuperBetter and Reality Is Broken. Jane McGonigal is today’s leading thinker on the engagement economy and the application of game-design to the real world.

Peter Schwartz, futurist and business strategist, specializes in scenario planning and working with corporations, governments, and institutions to create alternative perspectives on the future and strategies for an uncertain world. As Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning for Salesforce, he manages the organization’s ongoing strategic conversation and leads the Salesforce Futures LAB – a collaboration between Salesforce and its customers around provocative ideas about the future."

In this session you’ll learn how the company analyzes comprehensive pump repair information for a predictive maintenance program that saves money by extending the lives of pumps and preventing costly failures before they happen.  You’ll also see how analysis of maintenance data can lead to both short- and long-term cost savings for your customers.

And as SPS becomes increasingly IoT-enabled, the pumps themselves can communicate their status, alerting the company to equipment that is not functioning nominally.  The new data gleaned from real-time communications with its pumps, motors, and systems is helping SPS improve its customer and supplier relationships even further, and add value up and down to the supply chain – a great potential use case for Einstein analytics."

The key, she says, is to take a more inclusive approach to capitalism. As chairman of the Coalition for Inclusive Capitalism, she is campaigning to bring about a change in the nature of business so that it creates broad-based prosperity.The coalition, founded in 2014, was launched in response to the issues raised in the 2008 financial crisis. Its mission is to make capitalism more equitable, sustainable and inclusive through business and investment practices that extend the opportunities and benefits of our economic system to everyone. Lady Lynn believes, like many others, that the financial crisis revealed capitalism's flaws. Not only that, but ""its failings,"" as she wrote for Time magazine in December last year, ""are at the root of the social and political dysfunction gripping the world."" Wealth has been monopolized by the few, leading to inequality, stagnant wages, and a shrinking middle class. In this Dreamtalk, hear how Inclusive Capitalism will lift up many from poverty and prevent political unrest."
